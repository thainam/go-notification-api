#### 

**Important:** This GO application was created for learning purpose only. If you're new in GO maybe here you can explore a little bit more about the language.

## What is this application?

This application will have 4 endpoints:

üéâÔ∏è Available:

* GET /health - Endpoint to check if the webserver is healthy.
* GET /notifications - Endpoint to list the notifications from database.

üïô Work in Progress:

* GET /notifications/{id} - Endpoint to get details of a specific notification.
* POST /notifications - Endpoint to create a new notification.

## Where does Kafka fit into this application?

There's a Kafka Consumer working to read all notifications that comes into the topic and insert those into database (Sqlite3 -> `./notifications.db` File).

For now, it's only possible to publish the notification int Kafka topic using the Control-Center in `http://localhost:9021/` using the format below:

```json
{
    "Title": "Hello",
    "Message": "World!"
}
```

In the future will be possible to use an endpoint to publish the notifications to kafka. Like said above.

## How can I start the application?

Well, it's quite simple. You'll need to have Docker (and docker-compose) on your machine.

With this all set, just run:

`docker-compose up -d --build`

PS: Make sure you have this line not commented out in your hosts file:
`192.168.0.61 host.docker.internal`

Enjoy it! üéâÔ∏è
